## Content:

- Tetris Game Project developed in Python.

## Instructions:

- Install Python: First, ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/);

- Verify Python Installation: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and run python3 --version;

- Install Pygame: Now, install Pygame using pip. In the terminal, run pip3 install pygame;

- Create the Game File: Open a text editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, or even Notepad);
  
- Copy the Python code (tetris_game.py) into the editor;

- Save the file as tetris_game.py;

- Run the Game: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and navigate to the directory where you saved tetris_game.py;

- Run the game with: python3 tetris_game.py.

## Game Instructions:

- When you run the game, a random word will be chosen from a predefined list. The number of letters in the word will be displayed as underscores (`_`);

- Enter a single letter in the input box provided;
  
- Click the "Guess" button to submit your guess;
  
- You can only guess one letter at a time. Make sure it's a single alphabetical character;
  
- If you guess a letter that youâ€™ve already guessed, a message will inform you that you have already made that guess;

- If the guessed letter is in the word, it will replace the corresponding underscores with the letter;
  
- If the guessed letter is not in the word, your attempt count will decrease by one;

- The game will display how many attempts you have left. You start with a set number of attempts (usually 6);

- You win if you guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts;

- A congratulatory message will appear when you successfully guess the word;

- If you run out of attempts before guessing the word, a message will inform you that you lost, and it will reveal the correct word;

- Once the game is over (either win or lose), you can close the window to exit;

- Try to guess vowels first (like A, E, I, O, U) as they are common in many words;
  
- Pay attention to the letters you've already guessed to avoid repeating them;
  
- Think about common prefixes or suffixes in words to help narrow down your guesses.

### Used IDE: Visual Studio Code.
