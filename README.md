## Game Instructions:

- When you run the game, the Tetris screen will open, and the game will begin;

- If the game ends (the blocks reach the top), press any key to restart;

- Press the left arrow (←) key to move the current piece to the left;

- Press the right arrow (→) key to move the current piece to the right;
  
- Press the down arrow (↓) key to speed up the fall of the current piece. This also increases your score by 1 point per move down;
  
- Press the up arrow (↑) key to rotate the current piece;

- Every time you move a piece down using the down arrow, your score increases by 1 point;
  
- The score will be displayed at the top right of the screen under score;

- The next section at the right of the screen shows the next piece that will appear once the current piece is placed;

- If the blocks reach the top of the screen and no more moves can be made, the game is over;
  
- The message "GAME OVER" will appear on the screen;

- Press any key to reset and start a new game;

- The goal of the game is to create complete horizontal lines with the falling Tetris blocks. Each time a line is completed, it will disappear, and you'll score points.
